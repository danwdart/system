    # Known issues:
    #     - The libolm end‐to‐end encryption library used in many Matrix
    # clients and Jitsi Meet has been deprecated upstream, and relies
    # on a cryptography library that has known side‐channel issues and
    # disclaims that its implementations are not cryptographically secure
    # and should not be used when cryptographic security is required.
    # 
    # It is not known that the issues can be exploited over the network in
    # practical conditions. Upstream has stated that the library should
    # not be used going forwards, and there are no plans to move to a
    # another cryptography implementation or otherwise further maintain
    # the library at all.
    # 
    # You should make an informed decision about whether to override this
    # security warning, especially if you critically rely on end‐to‐end
    # encryption. If you don’t care about that, or don’t use the Matrix
    # functionality of a multi‐protocol client depending on libolm,
    # then there should be no additional risk.
    # 
    # Some clients are investigating migrating away from libolm to maintained
    # libraries without known vulnerabilities.
    #
